The following SAS script imports energy consumption data of buildings
in Toronto and then uses multiple SAS and SQL steps to clean the data.
The clean dataset is then exported as a csv file, which can later be used
for analysis.  The mean energy consumption was calculated for all operations
starting with the letter D.  There is a huge amount of variability in energy
consumption even in this narrow category of results.
